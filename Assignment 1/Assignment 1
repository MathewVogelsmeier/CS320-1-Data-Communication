** Keeping Yourself & Your Data Safe
The best way to keep yourself and your data safe is to track what you do online. The first thing you need to do is limit the amount of information you share on social media. Sharing to much information on social media can make it easier for cyber criminals and others to find and steal your information. Another good step to take is to create strong password. This is also a way to keep not just your data safe but yourself safe as well. Stay away from passwords like password or 123. It’s best to use a mix letters, numbers, and symbols to help create a strong password that is harder for people to crack. The next step is to try to search in incognito mode and use more than one search engine. When you use incognito mode it, it deletes your search history and any cookies. By doing this people will not be able check and see your search history. Also use different search engines. Most people rely almost entirely on Google Chrome when they should be using a variety of different browsers. Lastly and in most cases the most important is to use a VPN (Virtual Private Network). A VPN changes your IP address to make you look like your somewhere else thus making it is harder to track you. This is very important if you plan on using a public network, as people can track down your personal IP address and get into your computer easier from those areas.

* Conclusion
Even though these are just a few of the steps you can take to keep yourself safe online it can make all the difference in the world when put into practice.

In the future, I will bring us some examples of what I wrote about as well as some other applications you can be used to keep yourself safe. Such as VPNs, firewall protection, and anti-virus applications.
